# Movie-Recommendation-Model
Here I'm developing a content based recommendation model. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and wikipedia. The dataset is filtered out to include all US/UK movies from 1970 onwards. Later the ddataset will be extended to even older movies as well.
At the end of this project user will enter a movie name and will get a set of movies similar to it as a recommendation.
The new movies recommended will be based on genres, actors, directors, year released and average rating of the movie.
