# **Content Based Recommendation Model**
Here I'm developing a content based recommendation model. The dataset is filtered out to include all USA movies from 1970 onwards. Later the dataset will be extended to even older movies as well. At the end of this project user will enter a movie name and will get a set of movies similar to it as a recommendation.The new movies recommended will be based on genres, actors, directors, year released and average rating of the movie.
